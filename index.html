            <h2> About</h2>
    
            <p> Summer has been artistically influenced by the music of New Orleans, Louisiana. During her artistic experiences in Hawaii, Summer spent a vast amount of time singing in local clubs, bars, and even private events. At the start of her career, the songs Summer composed and performed were strongly influenced by the Hawaiian style, but also featuring a slight touch of blues, jazz, and classic rock genres. Upon Summer's arrival to New Orleans, Louisiana to study Jazz Vocal Performance at Loyola University, her performance style is now more heavily influenced on the jazz and blues aspects of the local surrounding music environment. Currently, Summer Kealoha performs covers of classic rock songs regularly at The Prohibition Bar and Balcony, located on Bourbon Street; however, Summer is open to singing at other venues and private events within the New Orleans area. Although, the majority of her performances consists of jazz and rock song covers, Summer Kealoha occasionally writes her own original songs. Summer's most recent composition, "Bad Near By", features the essence of New Orleans' grit, blues and originality as compared to her previous musical influences from Hawaii.</p>
